AUTO-DETECTING ADAPTER TYPE
===========================
Attempting to auto-detect adapter type from the first 1 million sequences of the first file (>> /Users/jorgeamaya/Desktop/Broad_Test/Data_Repo_iSeq_Mini/1000BC10c_S100_L001_R1_001.fastq.gz <<)

Found perfect matches for the following adapter sequences:
Adapter type	Count	Sequence	Sequences analysed	Percentage
Nextera	1945	CTGTCTCTTATA	12324	15.78
Illumina	0	AGATCGGAAGAGC	12324	0.00
smallRNA	0	TGGAATTCTCGG	12324	0.00
Using Nextera adapter for trimming (count: 1945). Second best hit was Illumina (count: 0)
