AUTO-DETECTING ADAPTER TYPE
===========================
Attempting to auto-detect adapter type from the first 1 million sequences of the first file (>> /Users/jorgeamaya/Desktop/Broad_Test/Data_Repo_iSeq_Mini/SP011228685210c_S106_L001_R1_001.fastq.gz <<)

Found perfect matches for the following adapter sequences:
Adapter type	Count	Sequence	Sequences analysed	Percentage
Nextera	852	CTGTCTCTTATA	4576	18.62
smallRNA	0	TGGAATTCTCGG	4576	0.00
Illumina	0	AGATCGGAAGAGC	4576	0.00
Using Nextera adapter for trimming (count: 852). Second best hit was smallRNA (count: 0)
