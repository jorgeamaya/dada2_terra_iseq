AUTO-DETECTING ADAPTER TYPE
===========================
Attempting to auto-detect adapter type from the first 1 million sequences of the first file (>> /Users/jorgeamaya/Desktop/Broad_Test/Data_Repo_iSeq_Mini/625E25KB110c_S146_L001_R1_001.fastq.gz <<)

Found perfect matches for the following adapter sequences:
Adapter type	Count	Sequence	Sequences analysed	Percentage
Nextera	332	CTGTCTCTTATA	6401	5.19
Illumina	0	AGATCGGAAGAGC	6401	0.00
smallRNA	0	TGGAATTCTCGG	6401	0.00
Using Nextera adapter for trimming (count: 332). Second best hit was Illumina (count: 0)
