AUTO-DETECTING ADAPTER TYPE
===========================
Attempting to auto-detect adapter type from the first 1 million sequences of the first file (>> /Users/jorgeamaya/Desktop/Broad_Test/Data_Repo_iSeq_Mini/625E110KA210c_S145_L001_R1_001.fastq.gz <<)

Found perfect matches for the following adapter sequences:
Adapter type	Count	Sequence	Sequences analysed	Percentage
Nextera	2981	CTGTCTCTTATA	17564	16.97
Illumina	0	AGATCGGAAGAGC	17564	0.00
smallRNA	0	TGGAATTCTCGG	17564	0.00
Using Nextera adapter for trimming (count: 2981). Second best hit was Illumina (count: 0)
